def report_block_size(block_size: int, token_counts: list) -> int:
    """Reports the requested block size against the dataset and returns it unchanged.

    `block_size` is the training sequence length, the `max_new_tokens` cap of the generation and
    part of every on-disk artifact name, so run_baseline.py and run_extrapolation.py have to
    arrive at the same value from the same inputs or their artifacts stop lining up. That is why
    this lives here instead of being duplicated in both.

    The requested value is authoritative. It used to be silently raised to the longest tokenized
    response of the dataset, which meant any --block_size below that longest response had no
    effect whatsoever and every artifact was named after a number nobody passed.

    Responses longer than the returned value are *not* discarded: utils/train_generation.py packs
    with trl's "wrapped" strategy, which concatenates and chunks, so a long response spans two
    blocks instead of losing its tail. What it does cost is that such a response is split across a
    block boundary during training, and that generation is capped at this many new tokens — so the
    share of the dataset above the block size is worth knowing and is reported here.

    Args:
        block_size (int): the requested block size
        token_counts (list): tokenized length of every response in the dataset
